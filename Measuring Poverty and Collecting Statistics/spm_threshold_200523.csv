"1Thresholds, standard errors, and population shares for 2005-2019 are based on out-of-pocket expenditures for food, clothing, shelter, and utilities (FCSU); shelter expenditures include those for mortgage principal payments and utilities including telephone expenditures.  Thresholds, standard errors, and population shares for 2019 revised, 2020, and 2021 are based on out-of-pocket expenditures for food, clothing, shelter, utilities, telephone, and internet (FCSUit) plus imputations for in-kind benefits for LIHEAP, NSLP, WIC, and rental assistance. For the 2019 revised, 2020, and 2021 thresholds, telephone is no longer considered part of utilities but is instead included independently and treated the same way as food and clothing. Additionally, internet is included; internet was not included in the estimation of 2005-2019 thresholds. “Percentage of weighted sample” refers to the shares of the weighted sample of consumer units with children (the estimation sample) by housing group within the 30th-36th FCSU expenditure percentile distribution for 2015-2019, and within the 47th-53rd FCSUti expenditures plus in-kind benefits percentile distribution for 2019 revised, 2020, and 2021.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2The thresholds in the table are those used by the Census Bureau to produce SPM poverty rates and related statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Prior to 2005, select fuels within utilities were represented by UCC 250901 – WOOD/KEROSENE/OTHER FUELS RNTR, UCC 250902 – WOOD/KEROSENE/OTHER FUELS OWND, UCC 250211--COAL RNTR, and UCC 250222 COAL OWND. In 2005, this set of UCCs was dropped and the following new UCCs introduced: UCC 250911 – OTHER FUELS RNTR and UCC 250912 – OTHER FUELS OWND.  Beginning with the production of the 2013 thresholds, the value of utilities was updated to incorporate the new UCCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Data for the 2017 and 2018 thresholds were finalized August 15, 2018, and September 10, 2019, respectively. However, a reprocessing of the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey data made after these dates resulted in changes to the distributions of FCSU expenditures. The thresholds in this table are produced using the data finalized in August 2018, and September 2019, not the reprocessed data. However, the reprocessing marginally affected the thresholds.  A comparison of the thresholds presented in this table and the reprocessed thresholds, and related shares and other statistics, can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/pir/spm/spm_201718_changes.htm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5  The 2019 revised and 2020 thresholds, standard errors, and population shares reflect all the changes approved September 30, 2020 by the Interagency Technical Working Group on the SPM for the production of the thresholds. For information regarding the impact of each change implemented, see the breakdown by SPM threshold components for 2019 and 2019 revised: https://www.bls.gov/pir/spm/spm_2019re_changes.htm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 The 2021 thresholds – like the revised 2019 and 2020 -- are based on changes approved September 30, 2020 by the Interagency Technical Working Group on the SPM for the production of the thresholds. As noted in footnote 1, the basis of the thresholds has been expanded to include, among other additions, the inclusion of imputed in-kind benefits.  Here we note that a correction was introduced in the computer code to produce the thresholds with in-kind benefits; this correction is with reference to renters receiving rent as pay.  Rent as pay is not included in SPM resources and, thus for consistency, should not be included in the thresholds. Incorrectly, rent imputations for renters reporting rent as pay were included in the revised 2019 and 2020 thresholds as part of the rent imputations; for 2021 thresholds there are no rent imputations for renters receiving rent as pay.  However, for comparison purposes, if one would like 2021 thresholds that are fully comparable to the published 2019 revised and 2020 thresholds, to the threshold values presented in the column ""2021"" above, add $5 to the threshold for owners with mortgages, $3 to the threshold for owners without mortgages, and $20 to the threshold for renters. To produce standard errors for the thresholds that include rent as pay imputations, to the standard errors in the column ""2021"" add $7 to the standard error for owners without mortgages and subtract $3 from the standard error for renters."" The threshold standard error for owners with mortgages are the same with and without the rent as pay correction. Also impacted by not including imputed rent as pay in the 2021 thresholds are the “percentage of weighted sample” by housing group. The weighted sample distribution by housing group for 2021 that is comparable to 2019 revised and 2020 is as follows: 0.467 for owners with mortgage, 0.087 for owners without mortgage, and 0.445 for renters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 2022 SPM thresholds are derived using the same methodology as the 2021 SPM thresholds plus the addition 6 minor changes to the methodology: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) the WIC sample has been expanded to include any women with children (ages 0-5) and any women without children (ages 15-45) following the Census methodology. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The SPM now uses the exact same values for NSLP and WIC as Census does, matching fiscal year to our CE year, following the Census method. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) The NSLP differentiation between Free and Reduced lunch now is done using 150% of the poverty line for ""free"". The rest of the sample above this line, identified by the Proc MI model to be ""free/Reduced"", is randomly split (50/50) between ""free"" and ""reduced"" following the Census method. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) A correction to the Proc MI code identifying the participation in WIC, NSLP, and LIHEAP was done that fixed the omission of the state of Alabama in previous years.                                                                                     ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) The SPM is now accounting for WIC EBTs, meaning at the time of a state's full implementation, the SPM assumes all WIC benefits are already captured in food expenditures (similarly to SNAP) and therefore no longer added to the FCSUti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) The imputed rent model is now based on the last month of rent (rentx3) rather than the summation of the previous 3 months, this in order to account for cases where a CU may have moved during that 3 month period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8 2023 SPM thesholds are derived using the same methodology as the 2022 SPM thresholds plus the inclusion of in-kind internet benefits provided by the Affordable Connectivity Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Source: Thresholds for 2005-2019 are based on the most recent 5 years of quarterly Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview data relative to the threshold year. For example, 2019 thresholds are derived from data collected in 2015Q2-2020Q1. Quarterly values are updated to threshold dollars using the All-Items CPI-U and multiplied by four to represent annual values. Thresholds for 2019 revised, 2020, 2021, and 2022 are based on 5 years of CE data lagged by one year. For example, 2019 revised thresholds are based on CE data from 2014Q2-2019Q1. Quarterly values are updated to threshold year dollars using a specially created CPI-U that is based on the components of the thresholds, the composite FCSUti CPI-U. For further information regarding the estimation of the thresholds, see: https://www.bls.gov/pir/spmhome.htm.  The threshold shares up through 2022 were produced by Juan D. Munoz under the guidance of Thesia I. Garner (Division of Price and Index Number Research, BLS). The 2023 thresholds were produced by Ryan M. Unitan under the guidance of Thesia I. Garner and using documentation written by Juan D. Munoz (Division of Price and Index Number Research, BLS). The SPM thresholds are referred to as “research” since they have not gone through the process to meet BLS production quality standards. The 2023 SPM thresholds and related statistics were finalized on May 13th, 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
